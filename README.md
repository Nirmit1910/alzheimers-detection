# HealthCoder - Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Brain MRI Images

## Project Overview

HealthCoder is a project focused on the classification of Alzheimer's disease using advanced AI techniques and brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images. The goal of the project is to develop an accurate and robust model that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

## Dataset: Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset

The project utilizes the ["Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 6400 preprocessed MRI images, resized to 128 x 128 pixels, representing different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

### Dataset Details

- Total Images: 6400
- Classes:
  - Class 1: Mild Demented (896 images)
  - Class 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)
  - Class 3: Non Demented (3200 images)
  - Class 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)

The dataset provides a diverse set of brain MRI images collected from several websites, hospitals, and public repositories. The images have been preprocessed and resized, making them suitable for further analysis and classification.

## Project Steps

This Github repository contains code and resources related to the development of machine learning models for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using various AI methods.
