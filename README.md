## Project Overview

HealthCoder is a project focused on the classification of Alzheimer's disease using advanced AI techniques and brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images. The goal of the project is to develop an accurate and robust model that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

## Objective

The objective of the project is to leverage AI techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify brain MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's disease. By accurately identifying the disease's progression, the model can aid healthcare professionals in making timely diagnoses and developing appropriate treatment plans.

The specific objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Preprocess the MRI images to enhance their quality, remove noise, and standardize the data.

2. Develop and train deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately classify MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Optimize and fine-tune the models to achieve high classification accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

3. Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare their performance to identify the most effective model.

4. Visualize the results, including the MRI images, model predictions, and evaluation metrics, to facilitate interpretation and analysis.

5. Create a comprehensive report summarizing the project, including the methodology, results, limitations, and potential areas for further improvement.

The project utilizes the ["Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 6400 preprocessed MRI images, resized to 128 x 128 pixels, representing different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

### Dataset Details

- Total Images: 6400
- Classes:
  - Class 1: Mild Demented (896 images)
  - Class 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)
  - Class 3: Non Demented (3200 images)
  - Class 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)

The dataset provides a diverse set of brain MRI images collected from several websites, hospitals, and public repositories. The images have been preprocessed and resized, making them suitable for further analysis and classification.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are utilized in the project:

- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used for building and training deep learning models.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow. It provides an intuitive interface for designing and training models.
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.
- Matplotlib: A popular plotting library used for data visualization, including the visualization of MRI images and performance metrics.
- NumPy: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance metrics.
